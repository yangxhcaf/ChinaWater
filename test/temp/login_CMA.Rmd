## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
url_root <- "http://data.cma.cn"
p <- GET("http://data.cma.cn/user/toLogin.html") %>% content(encoding = "utf-8")
url_vcode <- xml_find_first(p, "//img[@id='yw0']") %>% xml_attr("src") %>% paste0(url_root, .) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
plot.new(); rasterImage(p2, 0, 0, 1, 1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

```
